Good morning everyone. My name is Aja Sibley and I'm an engineer at Plurigrid. Today I want to share with you the work we’ve been doing to reimagine and redesign the power grid for the modern world.
To understand the challenges facing the grid today, we first need to understand how we got here. The history of computers goes back over 200 years, from the mechanical Babbage engine in 1837 to mobile and IoT devices today. The grid, however, was largely designed in the early 20th century, before many of these technologies even existed. It simply wasn’t built to handle the massive increase in connected devices, demand for renewable energy, distributed power generation, and more that we now rely on.
Some of the biggest issues utilities are grappling with include scalability, intermittency of renewables, managing distributed energy sources, ensuring interoperability among technologies, protecting against cyber threats, energy storage, processing huge amounts of data, and upgrading infrastructure that in some places is nearly a century old.
The solution, we believe, lies in a distributed grid that is decentralized, efficient, and resilient. It requires new ways of sharing and synchronizing data in real time, standardized and hardware-agnostic systems, and optimized software and firmware that can support diverse and complex devices.
To enable this, we’ve been working on standardized hardware-software interfaces that expose device features and functionality to higher level software. We’ve developed custom WebAssembly modules that provide standardized access to firmware, allowing us to build libraries for managing different devices. So far, we have implemented data synchronization between devices, built basic hardware interfaces to control power consumption, and have developed a prototype device that can monitor and manage the energy usage of appliances.
Going forward, we are building a prototype device to control outlet power and running our software stack on Nvidia’s Jetson Nano. We invite you to follow our open source work, join the discussion, and advocate for regulatory changes needed to make this transition possible. The future grid must be open, connected, and built for the challenges of the 21st century. Together, we can make the smart grid a reality.
Thank you, and I welcome any questions you may have!
